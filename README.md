More specifically, the app should allow a user to do the following.

- Click an operand or operator button to append its corresponding text to the screen.
  - If the screen displays the message `Error`, don't append anything.
- Click the `clear` button to remove all the text from the screen.
- Click the `equals` button to evaluate the arithmetic expression shown in the screen.
  - If the expression is in format `operand(+|-|x|รท)operand`, evaluate the expression and update the screen with the result.
  - If the expression isn't in the correct format or when attempting to divide by zero, update the screen with the message `Error`.

### Bonus 1
